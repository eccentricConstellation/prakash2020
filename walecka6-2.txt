R*gamma = 0.4627443681192471
solving xcotx + gamma*R = 0, we find x to be 1.8198000000034544
the first solution for V0 is 36.55349478052127 MeV
coefficients for radial wavefunction:
A = 0.5624530498735132 
C = 0.8658614055444437
integration from 0 to R of the probability density is  0.3548966140327295
